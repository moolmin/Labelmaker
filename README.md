 <h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>I found the process of receiving parcels was inefficient when I worked in logistics team, involving four steps: scanning part names, scanning invoice numbers, editing dates, and clicking the Excel output button. Especially when dealing with numerous parts, this process took too long to create labels. Thus, I conceived the idea of Python web scraping. By scanning only the invoice data and provide it to the company's ER system, I developed a program that automatically retrieves the rest of the information into Excel, making the entire process much smoother.</p>
